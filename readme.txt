2 seconds per page ... 1400+ pages available when scraper was made 2024-08-23.

Folder will appear on desktop, Excel-file will appear inside folder when scraper is finished.

IF you run the scraper twice on the same day it will override the file because the file name will be the same
(if you change amount of firms to scrape again, but with a new amount set - remember to change the file name)
              (the Excel file you plan to override needs to be closed if you are doing this)
