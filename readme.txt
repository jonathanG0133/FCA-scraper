Link-to-scrape example: https://register.fca.org.uk/s/firm?id=001b000000NMjRBAA1



stand in project main folder directory 
"npm install" reqiured to install package dependencies
"npm start" to run the script

Not multi-threaded   -   2 seconds per page ... 1400+ pages available when scraper was made 2024-08-23.

Folder "FCA Scraper" will appear on desktop, '.xlsx' Excel file will appear inside desktop folder once script is completely finished.

----


IF you run the scraper twice on the same day, it will override the file because the file name will be the same due to using dates to differentiate the Excel sheet names.

=> So if you want to change amount of firms being scraped by the script, but also keep the old Excel sheet retrieved the same day - remember to change the file name for the sheet that already exists for todays 
   date
   (the Excel file you plan to override needs to be closed when the script is about to finish if you are doing this)
